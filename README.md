# Opium Protocol iOS App

Welcome to the Opium Protocol iOS App repository! This project brings together a dynamic trio of components to offer a seamless and innovative experience for interacting with the Opium protocol.

## Overview

This project aims to revolutionize crypto finance by integrating UPI credit lines with the Gnosis Safe platform. Users can leverage their crypto assets as collateral to secure a credit line. This credit line can be accessed through the Gnosis Safe wallet, offering a secure and user-friendly interface. It enables instant fund access without liquidating assets, providing financial flexibility while maintaining control. The integration seamlessly blends traditional and crypto finance, allowing users to manage and utilize their funds efficiently. Through this innovation, the project empowers users to bridge the gap between their digital and financial worlds, paving the way for a new era of accessible and flexible crypto-backed lending.

At its core, the project revolves around the integration of UPI credit lines with the Gnosis Safe platform, offering users a novel way to leverage their crypto holdings.

Payments and Wallet Connectivity:

To facilitate payments, the project harnesses RazorPayX, streamlining the transactional aspect of the system.
Metamask SDK, a well-established tool for wallet integration, is employed to establish a secure and seamless connection between the user's wallet and the application.

### User Interface:

The user-facing side of the project is materialized through an iOS app built with SwiftUI. This choice of framework ensures a modern, intuitive, and responsive user experience, aligned with the standards of the iOS platform.

### Smart Contracts and Asset Management:

Underlying the project are Gnosis contracts, deployed both on the Base and Optimism chains. These contracts are pivotal in enabling non-custodial asset management, ensuring that users maintain control over their crypto holdings throughout the lending process.

### Technical Backbone:

The project's backend infrastructure is constructed using Rust, a programming language known for its performance, security, and reliability. Rust's design aligns with the project's goal of providing a robust and dependable foundation.

In this project, integration of RazorPayX, Metamask SDK, SwiftUI, Gnosis contracts creates a cohesive and dynamic ecosystem. The integration of these elements forms the backbone of a revolutionary approach to crypto-backed lending, fostering financial flexibility while maintaining user control.
